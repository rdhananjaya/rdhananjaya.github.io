My name is Dhananjaya, and here I blog about software development in general and programming language applications such as compilers, transpilers, and DSLs.

You can find more about me, [here in my linkedin profile](https://lk.linkedin.com/in/roshandhananajaya).

This blog is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted in [github-pages](https://pages.github.com/).
